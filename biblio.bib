The algorithm is based on a tree structure, and has reduced computation time by 40 percent over a previously published algorithm by identifying all equivalence classes with one scan of the EQUIVALENCE declarations. The method is applicable in any problem in which it is necessary to identify equivalence classes, given the element pairs defining the equivalence relation.},

Two algorithms using different data structures are discussed. The execution times of both algorithms are bounded by a constant times \$nG(n)\$, where \$G(n)\$ is a function whose asymptotic growth rate is less than that of any finite number of logarithms of n. }
